# Pair-cancelling bounded amplitudes

This file isolates the finite algebraic core of the proposed correlated-amplitude
Riesz-product construction for the Lonely Runner Conjecture.

No analytic Lonely Runner estimate is asserted here.  The main theorem says that
an affine transform of centred variables with covariance `-1 / s^2` has exactly
zero mixed second moment.

Exact pair cancellation under a normalized linear expectation.

The assumptions are precisely the first two moments needed by the calculation;
positivity of the expectation is not needed for this identity.
