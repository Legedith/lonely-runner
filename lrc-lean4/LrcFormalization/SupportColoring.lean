# Support colorings and exact quadratic cancellation

A family of finite supports records the low-order arithmetic relations that must
be controlled.  A coloring is proper for these supports when it is injective on
each support.  Pulling a pair-cancelling amplitude family back along such a
coloring kills every mixed quadratic term inside every recorded support.
